# Python Spigot Algorithm for π
A Python3 implementation of the spigot algorithm for π

The spigot algorithm is an algorithm that computes π on a digit-by-digit basis, much different from iterative algorithms, which compute an approximation of its value based on the number of iterations

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6 or above

## Install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nibble-4bits/py-spigot-algorithm.git
cd py-spigot-algorithm
```
